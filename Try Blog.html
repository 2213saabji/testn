use it for my practice The Poetry Translation Centre is very proud to partner </br>
with the Aké Arts and Books Festival to present a special series of translation <br>
workshops on the Nigerian languages of Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa.</br>
</p>
<p>
Join like-minded poetry lovers from across the world to discover new poetry and different </br>
cultures, share insights and language skills, working together to open up a poem in its </br>
original language and reassemble it in English. The result will be new group translations </br>
of contemporary Nigerian poems by Oladapo Olatubosun, Auwalu Anwar and Amarachi Attamah.</br>
</p>
<p>
To help in this task you will be guided by a translator who is an expert in the language that is </br>
the focus for that session, and a professional poet. They will offer</br> insight into the nuances of the language and culture, </br>and give helpful suggestions for the direction of the translation that is produced.</br>
</p>
<p>
Taking place online via Google Meet, the workshops are the perfect </br>way to keep yourself feeling creative, engaged and connected to </br>the world at large. A rough and ready guide translation is </br>provided by the guest translator so there is no need to know </br>the language being translated – simply sign up and bring your </br>love of poetry and language.
</p>
<p>
Three 90 minutes sessions focussing on a poem in each language will </br>take place on Thursday 22 October 2020:
Yoruba language workshop on the poetry of Oladapo Olatubosun: 10:00-11:30</br>
Hausa language workshop on the poetry of Auwalu Anwar: 12:30-14:00</br>
